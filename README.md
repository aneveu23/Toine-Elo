# Toine Elo
This repository contains an Elo rating algorithm that I am currently developing, intended to improve upon the methodology of Microsoft's TrueSkill to be more suited to sports where score differential can be treated as additional signal, and where roles within a team should have variable weight on the predicted outcome of the game (i.e. goalkeepers in soccer, quarterbacks in football).
